At the heart of our approach will be the development of more accurate simulations, supported by new state of the art 3D multiscale and time resolved in-situ analysis methods. This will allow us to accurately predict shape, microstructure, and properties in dynamically evolving complex materials systems.

This research will allow us to simultaneously engineer shape and properties, with more precision than currently possible, in more difficult materials, extended performance, and flexibly tailor thickness and properties in components. More precise digital simulation will also reduce product development cycles and costs.

With over 80% of all metallic components made from wrought, formed materials - the project will provide the critical science base required to allow UK industry to innovate in high value-added manufacturing.

The transport manufacturing sector is vital to the UK economy, being worth over Â£20bln to GDP, in value added, exporting 80% of its output, and employs nearly 500,000 skilled workers.

LightForm already has over 20 collaborating companies and our strong engagement with industry will provide a direct route for technology transfer and impact.

We also aim to address the severe skills shortage in the UK by training PhD students in a multidisciplinary environment across the frontiers of materials and manufacturing.
