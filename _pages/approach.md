We aim to provide UK industry with the enabling research for a new holistic approach that will lead to a step change in the cost-effective production of more mass-efficient and recyclable light alloy components. This will be realised through intelligently embedding materials engineering into the forming processes that shape components, by delivering the following core scientific objectives:

1.	Improve current fundamental understanding and modelling of key dynamic material interactions in forming light alloys (e.g. strain hardening in highly unstable strong alloys, where solute diffuses and precipitation occurs simultaneously with forming);

2.	Develop a virtual dynamic microstructure simulation tool, to populate parameter space, and compress the output into a computationally efficient form for implementation in industrial forming codes;

3.	Demonstrate the application of advanced modelling to exploit synergies between forming and microstructure engineering in innovative high impact MEME solutions.

Specifically we aim to develop the science and modelling capability that will allow LightForm to:

- Enable precise shape and microstructure prediction at the design stage, thus accelerating time to market, nearer-net-shape parts and the flexible forming and mass customisation of products;

- Demonstrate how embedded materials engineering can benefit industry, by utilising dynamic effects to intelligently engineer a material during manufacturing, so as to reduce process steps, extend formability and increase component performance;

- Develop pre-processing and forming routes that enable a wide spectrum of properties to be obtained from a reduced set of alloys, with a higher tolerance to contamination, facilitating closed loop recycling.

- Extend the limits of formability for low ductility materials (Ti, Mg) through embedded microstructure engineering, making these materials more cost-effective - by avoiding expensive alloys and processes;

- Tailor thickness simultaneously with properties and engineer near-surface structures, with higher surface quality and corrosion resistance, for higher performance in demanding environments.
